Edits And Updates:


Code changes, and comments. Rather than typing shit in for commits,
use this file to add notes about what changed to files, the push 
with the rest of the stuff. Include date. Newest changes at top.


11/08/2018: 
--AYO making progress here. ANN w/shitty indicators didnt work AT ALL,
however I grew a pair and went IN on the d1, d2, d3's (lmao) and getting 
some interesting results here.
--Changes basically adding indicators, sticking with BINARY classification
for now - regression models did NOT work - something fundamental going on 
there I think. 
--Stoke is high.


10/30/2018:
--Added make_labels_percent_gain function to assign a label to every day
where the stock increased above a threshold percentage. will use this to 
create ANN for classification. 
--Added method to StockClass to filter out nans. not sure how else to 
deal with this issue (also was a major bitch to get this working).
--Deleted a few delisted stocks from the data set to avoid errors
--Put the ticker import into a function called gather_tickers
--Added dope waitbar function
--Just about ready to make a first crack an ANN for use with a trading algo.
My idea is as follows: train ANN to spit out 1 for buy, 0 for sell on a day
befor stock is predicted to increase by some threshold percentage. compute 
this at the end of each day to determine whether to hold or sell stock the
following morning or in AH. an extention of this is to use regression or a 
finer classification to get a specific percentage change for following day, 
and perform larger iterative prediction (almost like recursion) to map out a 
trade plan. so: prediction1--> ANN--> prediction2--> ANN--> prediction3-->,
can use this n times and compare against realitiy for loss function in that 
sense. 
--Other ideas include computing indicator and performing k-means clustering,
would probably require normalizaiton of data. 
--Eventually would like to integrate DMD to correlate modes with buy signals.



10/19/2018:
--Added sector to each stock in SP500_Labels.txt. 
--Added additional class atribute called sector to identify each
 stocks sector. Changed stock.name to stock.ticker. 
--Upated methods to use symbol[i][0] b/c of sector additon.
--Would be nice to figure out how to get all the "tickers =" into 1 or 2 
lines instead of the 5 it currently uses. 


10/15/2018:
-- created a class StockClass to use for making all these instances of
stocks and stuff. not an expert in what this is doing exaclty but basically
trying to make things similar to how i had them in matlab. this will work 
for now. 
--parse_csv is used to get all the data from the csv files to the stock
variable which is a big ass list of stock classes. 
-- this is dope process. now we (i?) can actually start doing some data
processing and get this bish rolling!


10/4/2018: 
--scrapeData takes in list of S$P 500 stocks, saves to folder
which is defined in get_data. I set the path to be some other folder
outside of where I keep everything else to avoid clutter. Minor changes 
to methods to allow for null cookie values.
--in general, dont fuck with the CSVFiles folder. this should just be used
for some data storage, and as a backup for now.
--added this file to talk about changes.
