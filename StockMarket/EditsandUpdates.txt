10/15/2018:
-- created a class StockClass to use for making all these instances of
stocks and stuff. not an expert in what this is doing exaclty but basically
trying to make things similar to how i had them in matlab. this will work 
for now. 
--parse_csv is used to get all the data from the csv files to the stock
variable which is a big ass list of stock classes. 
-- this is dope process. now we (i?) can actually start doing some data
processing and get this bish rolling!


10/4/2018: 
--scrapeData takes in list of S$P 500 stocks, saves to folder
which is defined in get_data. I set the path to be some other folder
outside of where I keep everything else to avoid clutter. Minor changes 
to methods to allow for null cookie values.
--in general, dont fuck with the CSVFiles folder. this should just be used
for some data storage, and as a backup for now.
--added this file to talk about changes.
