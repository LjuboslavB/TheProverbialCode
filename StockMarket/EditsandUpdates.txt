10/4/2018: 
--scrapeData takes in list of S$P 500 stocks, saves to folder
which is defined in get_data. I set the path to be some other folder
outside of where I keep everything else to avoid clutter. Minor changes 
to methods to allow for null cookie values.
--in general, dont fuck with the CSVFiles folder. this should just be used
for some data storage, and as a backup for now.
--added this file to talk about changes.
