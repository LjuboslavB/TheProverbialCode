Edits and Updates:

Code changes, and comments. Rather than typing shit in for commits,
use this file to add notes about what changed to files, the push 
with the rest of the stuff. Include date. Newest changes at top.

10/4/2018: scrapeData takes in list of S$P 500 stocks, saves to folder
which is defined in get_data. I set the path to be some other folder
outside of where I keep everything else to avoid clutter. Minor changes 
to methods to allow for null cookie values.
